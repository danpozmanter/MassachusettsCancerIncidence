        <h2>Supplemental Information</h2>
        Taken verbatim directly from the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/cancer-incidence-in-massachusetts-citytown-supplement-2011-2015/download">City Town Supplement 2011-2015</a>.
        <h3>Observed and Expected Case Counts</h3>

        <p>The <strong>observed</strong> case count (Obs) for a particular type of cancer in a city/town is the actual number
        of newly diagnosed cases among residents of that city/town for a given time period.</p>

        <p>A city/town’s <strong>expected</strong> case count (Exp) for a certain type of cancer for this time period is a
        calculated number based on that city/town’s population distribution (by sex and among eighteen
        age groups) for the time period 2011-2015, and the corresponding statewide average annual agespecific incidence rates.
        The source of the city and town population data for the 2011-2015 period was the US Census American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing national survey that provides demographic estimates on a yearly basis.</p>

        <h3>Standardized Incidence Ratios</h3>

        <p>A <strong>Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR)</strong> is an indirect method of adjustment for age and sex that describes in numerical terms how a city/town’s cancer experience in a given time period compares with that of the state as a whole.

        <ul>
        <li>An SIR of exactly 100 indicates that a city/town’s incidence of a certain type of cancer is
        equal to that expected based on statewide average age-specific incidence rates.</li>

        <li>An SIR of more than 100 indicates that a city/town’s incidence of a certain type of cancer
        is higher than expected for that type of cancer based on statewide average annual agespecific incidence rates. For example, an SIR of 105 indicates that a city/town’s cancer incidence is 5% higher than expected based on statewide average annual age-specific incidence rates.</li>

        <li>An SIR of less than 100 indicates that a city/town’s incidence of a certain type of cancer is
        lower than expected based on statewide average age-specific incidence rates. For
        example, an SIR of 85 indicates that a city/town’s cancer incidence is 15% lower than
        expected based on statewide average annual age-specific incidence rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h3>Statistical Significance and Interpretation of SIRs</h3>

        <p>The interpretation of the SIR depends on both how large it is and how stable it is. Stability in this
        context refers to how much the SIR changes when there are small increases or decreases in the
        observed or expected number of cases. Two SIRs may have the same size but not the same
        stability. For example, an SIR of 150 may represent 6 observed cases and 4 expected cases, or
        600 observed cases and 400 expected cases. Both represent a 50 percent excess of observed
        cases. However, in the first instance, one or two fewer cases would change the SIR a great deal,
        whereas in the second instance, even if there were several fewer cases, the SIR would only
        change minimally. When the observed and expected numbers of cases are relatively small, their
        ratio is easily affected by one or two cases. Conversely, when the observed and expected
        numbers of cases are relatively large, the value of the SIR is stable.

        A 95 percent confidence interval (CI) has been presented for each SIR in this report (when the
        observed number of cases is at least 5), to indicate if the observed number of cases is significantly
        different from the expected number, or if the difference is most likely due to chance. A
        confidence interval is a range of values around a measurement that indicates the precision of the
        measurement. In this report, the 95% confidence interval is the range of estimated SIR values
        that has a 95% probability of including the true SIR for a specific city or town. If the 95%
        confidence interval range does not include the value 100.0, then the number of observed cases is
        significantly different from the expected number of cases. “Significantly different” means there
        is at most a 5% chance that the difference between the number of observed and expected cancer
        cases is due solely to chance alone. If the confidence interval does contain the value 100.0, there
        is no significant difference between the observed and expected numbers. Statistically, the width
        of the interval reflects the size of the population and the number of events; smaller populations
        and smaller observed numbers of cases yield less precise estimates that have wider confidence
        intervals. Wide confidence intervals indicate instability, meaning that small changes in the
        observed or expected number of cases would change the SIR a great deal.</p>
